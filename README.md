# AC-GANs
"Conditional image synthesis with Auxiliary Classifier GANs" --  https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09585 

In this project, you will find an adaptation of the AC-GANs architecture and the metrics described in the presented paper.
Tests are realised over two common datasets, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR10.

## AC-GANs architecture :

## Experiences realised : 
- Synthesis of fake images inspired from CIFAR10 and Fashion-MNIST
- Quality and diversity measures
- Up and downsizing interpolation to measure discriminability gain.
