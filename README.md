# AC-GANs
"Conditional image synthesis with Auxiliary Classifier GANs" --  https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09585 

In this project, you will find an adaptation of the AC-GANs architectures and the metrics described in the presented paper.
Tests are realised over two common datasets, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR10.

Results are : 
... (in coming)


Some of the code is inspired by :
