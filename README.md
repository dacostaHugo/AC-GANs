# AC-GANs
"Conditional image synthesis with Auxiliary Classifier GANs" --  https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09585 

In this project, you will find an adaptation of the AC-GANs architecture and the metrics described in the presented paper.
Tests are realised over two common datasets, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR10.

## AC-GANs architecture : 
![alt text](https://github.com/dacostaHugo/AC-GANs/images/archi.png)

## Experiences realised : 
- Synthesis of fake images inspired from CIFAR10 and Fashion-MNIST
- Quality and diversity measures
- Up and downsizing interpolation to measure discriminability gain.

## Metrics studied (specific to Generative models) : 
- Inception score
- MS-SIM
- ...


## Results :
... (in coming)
